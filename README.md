# undo2

A simple discord bot.

**THIS CODE IS ANCIENT! I would not recommend using it in any capacity.**
Made public in an unfinished state for archival (and application) purposes.

## Setup
<!--  TODO not make setup suck?? -->
1. Install node modules. I think you know how to do this.
2. Make the `.env` file look like this.
```
SECRET=bot_token_here
KSOFT=KSoft.Si_token_here
MOD_INTERCOM=channel_id_here
CONSOLE_CHANNEL=channel_id_here
```
3. Launch a redis server.
4. `npm start`.

## Dev Setup
1. Install VSCode.
2. Install the ESLint extension for it.
3. There's probably something I forgot.
